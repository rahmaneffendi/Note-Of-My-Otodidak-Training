# 4 IMPORTANT TIPS FOR PASSING A DEVOPS ENGINEER INTERVIEW

TIP #1 – During your DevOps interview, you will be asked a series of questions that fall broadly into the following three categories:

Technical competence interview questions;

Behavioral interview questions;

Motivational and research-based interview questions.

To ensure you are fully prepared for your DevOps Engineer interview, we strongly recommend you prepare answers to all 26 interview questions listed on this page.

TIP #2 – When responding to behavioral DevOps Engineer interview questions, we recommend you use the STAR technique to structure your answers. The STAR method is a proven structure for giving evidence-based answers that the hiring manager will be looking for from candidates. To use the STAR technique, simply follow this format when structuring your responses:

SITUATION – Tell the interviewer the situation you were faced with;

TASK – Briefly outline the task that you needed to do;

ACTION – Go into specific details relating to the action you took to achieve the task;

RESULT – Tell the interviewer or hiring manager the results following your actions. 

TIP #3 – At the end of your DevOps Engineer interview, make sure you ask the interview panel at least three intelligent and smart questions. Here’s a list of questions to ask in your DevOps interview:

What are the most difficult DevOps challenges you have been facing from an organizational perspective over the last 12-months?

If I am successful, what would you need me to concentrate on immediately within the first few weeks of starting?

Can you tell me what the culture is like within the organization?

Do you have any exciting or new plans for the organization over the forthcoming 12 months that I would be involved in if I am successful?

TIP #4 – At some stage during the interview you may need to negotiate your DevOps salary. Whilst these discussions can sometimes be uncomfortable, the best way to get the highest DevOps Engineer salary possible, is to research the ‘average salary’ for a DevOps Engineer, and then choose a figure that is slightly above the median salary range for the industry. For example, if the average salary range for a DevOps Engineer is $90,000 to $110,000, tell the interviewer you feel you are worth the top salary of $110,000; however, because you need to prove to them your worth, you are prepared to accept a salary of $102,000.
